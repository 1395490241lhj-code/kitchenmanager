### Added

- Added `AGENTS.md` as the common entry point for AI coding agents.
- Added `AI_CONTEXT.md` to summarize product direction, architecture context, and AI feature boundaries.
- Added `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to track current project status, risks, and next priorities.
- Added `CODING_RULES.md` to define project-specific coding and architecture rules.
- Added `TESTING_RULES.md` to define automated and manual validation expectations.
- Added optional tool adapter files `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` for Claude Code and Cursor.

### Changed

- No application runtime code changed.

### Fixed

- No bug fixes in this documentation-only update.

### Notes

- These files are designed to complement the existing `PROJECT_GUIDE.zh.md`, `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`, and `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` documents.
- The repository should be treated as the source of truth for project progress, coding standards, testing standards, and AI-agent handoff.

## 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added a lightweight "unreasonable / dislike" feedback entry for AI recommendations: a "不合理/不喜欢" action on the AI creative recommendation card (home "今日" tab's "更多操作" sheet and the desktop hero panel card) and on the AI draft recipe detail page.
- Added `src/utils/ai-disliked-recipes.js` (`getDislikedAiRecipeNames` / `markAiRecipeDisliked` / `isAiRecipeDisliked`), backed by a new `S.keys.ai_disliked_recipes` (`km_v1_ai_disliked_recipes`) localStorage key, capped at 100 entries (oldest evicted first).
- Added `test/ai-disliked-recipes.test.mjs` covering storage limits, prompt injection, `validateRecommendationResult`/`processAiData` filtering, and the UI wiring.

### Changed

- `callCloudAI()` now injects disliked dish names into the recommendation prompt, asking the AI to avoid recommending the same or highly similar dishes.
- `validateRecommendationResult()` and `processAiData()` now drop any `local`/`creative` entry whose name matches a disliked entry, in addition to the existing dark-cuisine (`isSuspiciousAiCreativeDish`) filter.

### Fixed

- No unrelated bug fixes in this change.

### Notes

- Xiaohongshu import, receipt recognition, weekly-menu planning/date scheduling, the `plan` data structure, `server.js`, and the AI draft-method save flow were not touched.
